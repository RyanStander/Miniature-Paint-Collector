# Privacy Policy

Paint Forge is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your information. This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect data in connection with the use of our mobile application.

## 1. Information Collection:
Paint Forge does not collect any personal information from users. When the app is launched, it generates a unique ID for local storage purposes. This ID is used to save paint catalog data to the cloud.

## 2. Data Usage:
The data collected by Paint Forge is used solely for app functionality and user-side displays of paint collection data.

## 3. Third-Party Access:
Unity, our cloud storage provider, has access to the data collected by Paint Forge through Unity Cloud save services.

## 4. Data Security:
We take data security seriously. All external communication for cloud save is served through our gateways, which enforce HTTPS. Requests from the gateways to cloud save are encrypted in transit to ensure data protection.

## 5. User Rights:
Paint Forge does not collect personal data, so there are no options for users to review, edit, or delete personal information.

## 6. Consent:
Since no personal data is collected, no user consent is required for data collection and processing.

## 7. Age Restrictions:
There are no age restrictions for users of Paint Forge.

## 8. Data Sharing:
Paint Forge does not share user data with any third parties for analytics, advertising, or any other purposes.
